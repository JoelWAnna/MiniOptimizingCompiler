\paragraph{CS401 Optimization Week 5 report} 
.\\
This week I spent the first couple of hours of work on correcting my guess at sweet syntax. After familiarizing myself with the existing sweet code
I was able to get my code to generate with minor changes.\\
I additionally spent time reading through the updated MIL documentation, I noticed that anytime that != occurs in a function it is incorrectly typeset in the document.
\paragraph{}I was able to start the groundwork on the data flow analysis, but preparing for midterms reduced the amount of time that I wanted to spend on the project. I believe that I have a workable implementation for storing in/out sets, and am in the process of computing the meets of the outsets coming into the inset of a particular block.
